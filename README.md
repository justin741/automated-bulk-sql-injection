Bulk SQL Injection Tool is an automated solution designed to identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities across a wide range of websites.

By leveraging a predefined list of Google dorks, the tool efficiently discovers URLs that may be susceptible to SQL injection attacks.


Once potential targets are identified, the tool employs SQLMap to perform automated testing, assessing each URL for vulnerabilities. This streamlined process allows users to quickly evaluate the security posture of numerous domains, including various TLDs, enhancing their understanding of web vulnerabilities and database security practices.


Key Features:
• Automated discovery of SQL injection vulnerabilities

• Support for bulk URL processing

• Integration with SQLMap for vulnerability testing

• Utilizes Google dorks for effective target identification


Usage Instructions:
To get started, please create two text files in the root directory:

urls.txt: Add the list of target URLs to be scanned.

queries.txt: Add the SQL injection queries you want to test.
